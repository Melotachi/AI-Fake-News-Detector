According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Unfortunately for the world, that wasn t a deal breaker for the 25 percent of Americans who voted for the demagogic self-described billionaire. Since rumored sexual assault isn t a big enough deal to keep someone out of the White House, why not put more people who are accused of violence against women in, right?As Trump has named cabinet pick after cabinet pick, each worse than the one before them, the fact that each comes with a controversial past seems to bother no one on the right.Trump s pick for national security advisor is a white nationalist who tweeted this:U decide   NYPD Blows Whistle on New Hillary Emails: Money Laundering, Sex Crimes w Children, etc MUST READ! https://t.co/O0bVJT3QDr  General Flynn (@GenFlynn) November 3, 2016His secretary of education hates schools. His pick for the head of the Environmental Protection Agency doesn t believe the environment needs protecting and (how s this for draining the swamp?) his treasure secretary pick is a former Goldman Sachs exec   you know   one of the companies that crashed the economy. It gets worse, though. According to Alternet, three of Trump s key team members have been accused of sexually or otherwise violently assaulting women.The first is the charmer, Steve Bannon. In a 1996 report, the white supremacist and former head of Breitbart was accused by his then wife of grabbing her by the neck during an argument. He was charged with domestic violence, misdemeanor witness intimidation and traumatic injury and battery. The charges were dropped, though, because his wife didn t show up for court.This one will probably surprise few. Trump s pick for labor secretary is fast food CEO Andrew Puzder. His restaurants include Hardee s and Carl s Jr., both of which are known for scantily clad women in near pornographic situations in their ads. During their divorce, Puzder s ex-wife accused him of attacking her three times, including punching her when they were riding in a car.Then, in 1986, Henning said Puzder  attacked me, choked me, threw me to the floor, hit me in the head, pushed his knee into my chest, twisted my ar m and dr agged me   on the floor, threw me against a wall, tried to stop my call to 911 and kicked me in the back. Source: NY MagazinePuzder responded to a reporter who asked him about the incident in a way that sounds a lot like his soon to be boss. He issued a thinly veiled threat against the reporter: There was no physical abuse at any point in time. If ever something was filed to gain personal benefit, this is it. If you re trying to smear me by raising the fact that my ex-wife made some charges against me, you re making a big mistake. It would not be good journalistic practice to publish this. Puzder s ex-wife has withdrawn the charges.Trump has also had numerous charges of sexual assault levied against him, beginning with his ex-wife Ivana. All told, Trump has been accused by about a dozen women, all of which he threatened to sue. As I said before, though, Trump s supporters don t care.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Illinois Republican Governor Bruce Rauner, who kicked off his 2018 re-election campaign this week, saw his first term marred by a political impasse that left Illinois without a budget for two years before lawmakers overrode his veto this summer to raise taxes.     Governors in the new ad include Missouri\\u2019s Eric Greitens, Wisconsin\\u2019s Scott Walker and Indiana\\u2019s Eric Holcomb - all Republicans like Rauner - thanking Rauner\\u2019s political foil, Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, for blocking reforms, raising taxes and sending jobs to their states. \\u201cHoosiers love you, Mike Madigan,\\u201d Holcomb said in the ad. Among the Democrats whom Rauner, a wealthy businessman, could face after a March primary are J.B. Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt Hotels Corp fortune, and Chris Kennedy, son of the late U.S. Senator Robert Kennedy.        The governor\\u2019s race in the fifth-largest state is expected to rank among the most expensive in the country. Experts who follow elections said the ad was unusual. \\u201cThis is creative since it uses GOP governors from surrounding states to shift the blame for Illinois\\u2019 woes from Rauner to a Democratic leader,\\u201d University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato said.  \\u201cVoters usually hold their governor responsible for the state of the state,\\u201d he added.  While it is not unusual for governors to make appearances for other campaigns, they tend to take a more positive approach, highlighting an incumbent\\u2019s achievements, said Dick Simpson, a political science professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago.     While the ad may resonate with rural, conservative voters, it also comes as Illinois and other states seek to attract Amazon.com\\u2019s $5 billion second headquarters. Simpson said highlighting how Illinois policies hurt the state is \\u201cprobably not helpful.\\u201d     Madigan dismissed the ad in a statement, calling it a \\u201crace to the bottom being led by his role models from states where middle-class wages are a fraction of what they are in Illinois.\\u201d     Rauner has feuded with Democrats, who control the state legislature, over his insistence a state budget be tied to policy demands that would weaken unions, impose legislative term limits and freeze property taxes.     He also has angered conservatives by signing a bill to expand state-funded coverage of abortions. Political scientists said he faces a tough re-election bid in a state often carried by the Democratic candidate in presidential elections. Spending on the race could top $150 million, a rarity, said Sarah Brune, executive director of the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Please leave us a comment (below) and tell us.\",\n          \"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:\\n\\nBill Clinton: \\u2018Natural\\u2019 For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors\\n\\nHere\\u2019s Google:\\n\\nNaturally, my reaction was \\u201coh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife\\u2019s campaign now?\\u201d\\n\\nOf course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don\\u2019t do, to find out the real story \\u2013 and the real story is that there is no pay to play.\\n\\n\\u201cIt was natural for people who\\u2019ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn\\u2019t do anything they shouldn\\u2019t do,\\u201d Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN\\n\\nIn other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn\\u2019t mean they\\u2019ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there\\u2019s no evidence they got them.\\n\\nNow, let\\u2019s talk about the foundation the media doesn\\u2019t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn\\u2019t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.\\n\\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump\\u2019s charitable foundation over concerns that it \\u201cengaged in some impropriety\\u201d as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others\\u2019 contributions \\u201cto make them appear to have come from him\\u201d although he \\u201chasn\\u2019t given to the foundation since 2008.\\u201d Source: Media Matters\\n\\nMedia Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton\\u2019s candidacy:\\n\\nJournalists have been criticized for the \\u201cdouble standard\\u201d in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton\\u2019s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post\\u2019s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump\\u2019s Dr. Oz stunt.\\n\\nAll of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton \\u201cscandal\\u201d (if you call getting sick a \\u201cscandal\\u201d) while ignoring every scandal in Trump\\u2019s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.\\n\\nFeatured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images.\",\n          \"The FBI has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against Hillary Clinton\\u2019s use of a private e-mail server. The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clinton\\u2019s top aide Huma Abedin.\\r\\n\\r\\nApparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained \\u201ctens of thousands of e-mails\\u201d from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillary\\u2019s e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clinton\\u2019s use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed \\u201cdismay,\\u201d and \\u201cdisgust\\u201d with Director Comey\\u2019s decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.\\r\\n\\r\\nA high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, \\u201cIt was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton\\u2019s] security clearance yanked.\\u201d\\r\\n\\u201cIt is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,\\u201d the senior FBI official told Fox News. \\u201cWe were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said \\u2018but we are doing nothing,\\u2019 which made no sense to us.\\u201d\\u200a\\u2014\\u200aFox News\\r\\nUPDATE October 17, 2016:\\r\\nThe FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton\\u2019s private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official \\u201cpressured\\u201d the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clinton\\u2019s e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called \\u201cThe Shadow Government\\u201d who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that \\u201cplaced Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for \\u2018her election campaign\\u2019\\u201d.\\u200a\\u2014\\u200aBBC News\\r\\n\\r\\nUPDATE October 25, 2016:\\r\\nAccording to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official\\u2019s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton\\u2019s use of a private e-mail server.\\r\\n\\r\\nUncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta\\r\\nIn September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user \\u201cstonetear\\u201d, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton\\u2019s private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clinton\\u2019s private e-mail server.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton.

They may not care, but I seems like they will.\\u200a\\u2014\\u200ahttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9545\\r\\nIn other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clinton\\u2019s communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nUPDATE October 25, 2016: Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 18 Confirms Intent of Cover Up\\r\\nOn March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clinton\\u2019s private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official\\u2019s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton\\u2019s use of a private e-mail server.\\r\\n\\r\\nFwd: POTUS on HRC emails\\r\\nFrom:cheryl.mills@gmail.com To: john.podesta@gmail.com Date: 2015\\u201303\\u201307 21:41 Subject: Fwd: POTUS on HRC emails\\r\\nwe need to clean this up\\u200a\\u2014\\u200ahe has emails from her\\u200a\\u2014\\u200athey do not say state.gov\\r\\n\\u2014\\u200a\\u2014\\u200a\\u2014\\u200a\\u2014\\u200a\\u2014 Forwarded message\\u200a\\u2014\\u200a\\u2014\\u200a\\u2014\\u200a\\u2014\\r\\nBegin forwarded message: *From:* Josh Schwerin <joshschwerin@gmail.com> *Date:* March 7, 2015 at 6:33:44 PM EST *To:* Jennifer Palmieri <jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com>, Kristina Schake < kristinakschake@gmail.com>, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>, Jesse Ferguson <jfferg@gmail.com> *Subject:* *POTUS on HRC emails*\\r\\nhttps://twitter.com/katherinemiller/status/574350749280432129/photo/1 Jen you probably have more on this but it looks like POTUS just said he found out HRC was using her personal email when he saw it in the news.\\u200a\\u2014\\u200ahttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/31077#efmAABABT\\r\\nUPDATE October 20, 2016: Podesta E-mails Release 13 Confirms President Obama Knew Of Clinton\\u2019s Private E-mail Server\\r\\nOn Mar 8, 2015, at 7:56 AM, Jennifer Palmieri <jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com<mailto:jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com>> wrote:\\r\\nThey know POTUS and HRC emailed. Josh has been asked about that. Standard practice is not to confirm anything about his email, so his answer to press was that he would not comment/confirm. I recollect that Josh was also asked if POTUS ever noticed her personal email account and he said something like POTUS likely had better things to do than focus on his Cabinet\\u2019s email addresses.\\r\\nOn Mar 8, 2015, at 12:40 AM, Philippe Reines <pir@hrcoffice.com<mailto:pir@hrcoffice.com>> wrote:\\r\\nI find it odd the NYT didn\\u2019t actually quote the President saying what\\u2019s in their headline. Especially since the story has a disbelieving tone to his not noticing. One of us should connect with the WH just so they know that the email will show his statement to not make sense. I\\u2019m happy to do so to Josh Earnest since Jen is in a weird position, unless Cheryl or John you want to (or already have) with someone else. But it\\u2019s not unreasonable to assume that Josh is going to get asked how this was possible, and he should have the factset. Especially if it\\u2019s some weird technical thing with the President\\u2019s email setup that he doesn\\u2019t see addresses.\\u200a\\u2014\\u200ahttps://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/21779\\r\\nTo make matters even worse for the cover up, in another leaked e-mail, Erika Rottenberg, another Clinton attorney, admits Hillary Clinton personally deleted many of the e-mails herself without oversight.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren\\u2019t satisfied with answers to date. While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I\\u2019ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc.\\u200a\\u2014\\u200ahttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099\\r\\nThe reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President\\u2019s communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.\\r\\n\\r\\nTimeline of Events:\\r\\nMarch 2, 2015: The New York Times breaks the story that Clinton used a personal e-mail account while Secretary of State.\\r\\nMarch 4, 2015: The Benghazi committee issues a subpoena requiring preservation of all e-mails.\\r\\nMarch 7, 2015: Barack Obama states he only learned about the private e-mail server \\u201cthrough news reports\\u201d at the same time as everybody.\\r\\nMarch 7, 2015: 15:41:16 -0800 (PST) Cheryl Mills writes EMAIL ID 31077 as revealed by Podesta Emails Part 18: \\u201cwe need to clean this up\\u200a\\u2014\\u200ahe has emails from her\\u200a\\u2014\\u200athey do not say state.gov.\\u201d\\r\\nMarch 7, 2015: Hillary Surrogate Terry McCauliffe met with the FBI agent who oversaw the Clinton e-mail case and his wife and promised financial support ($500k+) if she ran for office.\\u200a\\u2014\\u200aWall Street Journal\\r\\nMarch, 25\\u201331, 2015: Paul Cobetta, a Platte River Networks employee, permanently and irreversibly deletes the email archive using a software called BleachBit likely under orders from Cheryl Mills after receiving advice on Reddit on how to delete e-mails for a \\u201cVIP\\u201d.

Brand New Theory Has Serious PROOF Hillary Clinton\\u2019s health is the top issue in the Presidential campaign. Once considered a \\u201cconspiracy theory,\\u201d Americans now see that Hillary Clinton suffers from serious problems, including neurological diseases.\\n\\nAfter her September 11th collapse and fainting, even the pro-Hillary media can\\u2019t hide the truth.\\n\\nNow, expert Clif Hite (below) comes up with the most compelling theory about Hillary Clinton\\u2019s health yet, and you haven\\u2019t heard it before. He believes Hillary has died, and is replaced by multiple body doubles and CGI images. If true, this is the biggest coverup in the history of American politics. What a bombshell!:\\n\\n\\n\\nAs BeforeItsNews reports:\\n\\nNote: Russian Intel is using my video to prove they used Green Screen in Greensboro! It\\u2019s all fake folks! You\\u2019ll see my video below. The Russians who track Hillary say she never left Chelsea\\u2019s apartment and she\\u2019s using doubles! Also check out the part where Russia shows the emails proving Hillary was in a secret plane crash and hurt badly! At first they laugh at Sorcha Faal\\u2019s report but then admit it\\u2019s \\u201ccredible\\u201d! Huge info here! Stew Webb and Tom Heneghan reported on this plane crash when it happened!\\n\\nDo you believe that Hillary Clinton was injured or killed in a crash, and replaced by CGI?

People who watched the debate at parties, bars, restaurants, and offices were not counted. Neither were C-SPAN viewers.\\n\\nThis means the actual total audience is even higher.\\n\\nOn the TV side, CNN and other cable news channels saw big increases over past election years. So did the broadcast networks.\\n\\nNBC had the biggest audience overall, partly because \\\"NBC Nightly News\\\" anchor Lester Holt was the moderator of the debate. Upwards of 18 million people watched the debate on NBC.\\n\\nABC drew 13.5 million viewers, CBS drew 12.1 million, Fox News drew 11.4 million, CNN drew 9.9 million, the Fox broadcast network drew 5.5 million, and MSNBC drew 4.9 million.\\n\\nThe debate was also a hit on Spanish language television, attracting 2.5 million viewers on Univision and 1.8 million on Telemundo.\\n\\nTrump may have been the ratings magnet, but Clinton may have been the beneficiary of the ratings bump. By Tuesday there was a media consensus that Clinton had prevailed in the debate.\\n\\nThe debate viewership number to beat was 80.6 million, set back in 1980, when Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan debated just once before the election.\\n\\nMore recently, the first Obama-Romney debate in 2012 averaged 67 million viewers.\\n\\nDetailed Nielsen data confirms that viewership stayed high the entire time. Contrary to some speculation, there was not a big drop-off after the first 30 minutes of the 98-minute debate.\\n\\nThe vast majority of viewers kept watching until the very end, a fact that the Clinton campaign celebrated on Tuesday.\\n\\nEarlier story: Ratings expectations for first Trump-Clinton debate are sky high\\n\\nAnticipation for the Clinton-Trump meeting had been mounting for months. Television industry executives were anticipating a total audience somewhere between 80 and 100 million.\\n\\nThere will be two more debates between the candidates in October.\\n\\nOn Monday night Twitter said the first face-off was the \\\"most tweeted debate ever.\\\"\\n\\nGiven the rapid growth of streaming options, it was almost certainly the most streamed debate ever, as well.\\n\\nVarious live streams on YouTube together registered more than 2.5 million simultaneous viewers. Live streams on other sites also reached millions of people.\\n\\nOn both Twitter and Facebook, Trump was a livelier subject than Clinton. Twitter said the \\\"final share of conversation around the candidates on stage\\\" was 62% for Trump and 38% for Clinton.\\n\\nOn Facebook, the results were even more lopsided, with Trump earning 79% share of conversation and Clinton having the remaining 21%.\\n\\nBeing talked about isn't necessarily a good thing for a candidate. Most commentators gave Clinton the edge over Trump after the debate.\\n\\nStill, the post-debate coverage on TV focused on Trump, partly because of surprising and confounding comments he made on stage.\\n\\nCNN's reality check team investigated 26 claims made by Clinton and Trump and found that Trump made a greater number of misleading statements.\",\n          \"Nine years ago, a driver lost control of his pickup truck and crashed into the Confederate monument on the front lawn of the Franklin County Courthouse, decapitating the marble soldier. Some locals who found the monument offensive said they were glad to see it go, but there was never much doubt that once the money was raised, the soldier would be back.\\n\\nThe rededication ceremony in 2010 drew a crowd of about 500 people\\u2014women wore hoop skirts and men donned the gray uniforms of Confederate soldiers. \\u201cWe\\u2019re very proud of it,\\u201d says Linda Stanley, managing director of the Franklin County Historical Society in Rocky Mount, Virginia, 25 miles southeast of Roanoke. \\u201cThis whole county\\u2019s very, very patriotic.\\u201d\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nThis was the way skirmishes over Confederate history have often gone\\u2014history is replaced, not rewritten. That is, until last year, when white supremacist Dylann Roof gunned down nine people at an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina. The massacre set off a national debate about Confederate symbols in public places, leading to an intense and ultimately successful campaign to permanently remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol grounds, where it had flown for decades.\\n\\nBut for every nationally publicized debate like the one over South Carolina\\u2019s flag, there are dozens of smaller battles in places like Franklin County. And this is especially true in Virginia, which, as the former home to the capital of the Confederacy, has more Confederate monuments\\u2014223\\u2014than any other state. Virginia, increasingly diverse and progressive, embodies the friction between the economic aspirations of the \\u201cNew South\\u201d and the still powerful nostalgia of the Old Dominion, and it\\u2019s a drama that is playing out in town squares across the state.\\n\\nThough a Quinnipiac University poll last summer found Virginians evenly divided on the governor\\u2019s decision to remove the Confederate flag from state license plates, pride in local monuments remains strong. When city leaders in Danville, on Virginia\\u2019s southern border, voted to remove a Confederate flag from the grounds of the Sutherlin Mansion\\u2014known as the Last Capitol of the Confederacy\\u2014Confederate preservationists struck back. They filed a lawsuit seeking to have the flag reinstated, arguing that it was part of a war memorial, and that Virginia law protected all war memorials in the state. Last fall, a circuit court judge ruled against them.\\n\\nThat ruling\\u2014along with the increasingly frequent threats to monuments around the state\\u2014prompted the Republican delegate from Franklin County to demand in January a blanket protection for what has been a feature of Southern urban landscapes for more than a century. Charles Poindexter introduced a bill in the General Assembly to prevent the removal of all war monuments, regardless of when they were built. \\u201cIf you eliminate these monuments and memorials, you\\u2019re taking away the opportunity to learn the history of the country\\u2014to learn the good, the bad and ugly,\\u201d Poindexter says.\\n\\nMany of his colleagues in the Virginia Legislature agreed with him. But in March, Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed the bill, saying cities and towns should decide what to do with their Confederate monuments, based on their individual histories. Some historians and civic leaders think the debate over Confederate symbols in public spaces, which began in the 1960s, will take decades to play out.\\n\\n\\u201cEvery little statue\\u2019s a part of a much larger discussion and movement,\\u201d says Edward Ayers, former president of the University of Richmond and noted Civil War historian. \\u201cAfrican-Americans now have a political voice, and this is one of the things that they\\u2019re using it for.\\u201d\\n\\n***\\n\\nMark Whitaker remembers walking by the 30-foot-tall Confederate monument in Portsmouth, Virginia, when he was a kid. Shopping at a store across the street, he resented looking at the obelisk guarded by stone soldiers; his parents had told him what it represented. \\u201cMy ancestors could not say a thing in the face of that indignity,\\u201d Whitaker says.\\n\\nNow, as an African-American City Council member in a city that is 53 percent black, he wants to remove the monument from the center of Olde Towne, and perhaps put it in a cemetery. \\u201cThese monuments are really a rally and a celebration [of] the rise of an institution that oppressed black people,\\u201d he says.\\n\\nMany of the Confederate monuments were built from the 1880s through the 1920s, an era when Civil War veterans were dying and their descendants were eager to honor them. It was also the era immediately following Reconstruction, when federal troops abandoned the South and whites aimed to reassert power through Jim Crow laws, lynchings and groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. Granite and marble monuments proclaimed that power, often in the center of town.\\n\\nBut even in a majority-black city on the eastern shore of the state, Whitaker has battled to get Portsmouth\\u2019s monument removed. Last summer, attorney Fred Taylor, who also represented Confederate preservationists in the Danville case, warned the city that state law prohibited it from moving the monument. \\u201cWe believe the monument protection act covers the monument in Danville, covers the monument in Portsmouth,\\u201d Taylor says. He argues that the original Virginia statute protecting war monuments dates back to 1902, so \\u201cthere has been protection all along.\\u201d\\n\\nWhen the circuit court judge ruled against him in Danville, Taylor appealed the case to the Virginia Supreme Court. So far, the court has not agreed to hear the case.\\n\\nBack in Portsmouth, the debate continues. Some residents don\\u2019t want the city to spend upward of $100,000 to move the monument\\u2014a position Whitaker finds ridiculous. \\u201cWhy now, when we talk about moving a symbol of racism, we\\u2019re concerned about cost?\\u201d\\n\\nHe says the Portsmouth City Council had been waiting to hear the outcome of the Danville court case but could resume its discussion of the monument after the November elections. \\u201cWe\\u2019re on solid legal grounds to remove it,\\u201d he says. \\u201cWe just need four votes.\\u201d\\n\\n***\\n\\nOther Virginia cities have struck a middle ground, forming committees to figure out what to do with their Confederate monuments. In May, Charlottesville convened a Blue Ribbon Commission on Race, Memorials, and Public Spaces. Although the move was sparked by a controversial statue of Robert E. Lee in a public park, Mayor Mike Signer was determined to broaden the conversation, with an eye toward changing the city\\u2019s entire historic landscape.\\n\\nHe asked the commission to look at several landmarks, from an African-American cemetery that had fallen into disrepair to the statue of a Confederate boy in front of the courthouse. Members of the panel have discussed rehabbing and creating new historic interpretations for these sites, building new monuments to African-American leaders and linking all the sites so that visitors can see how they are connected. There might even be a virtual, mobile educational component to help people navigate the sites. The goal, Signer says, is to change the narrative of Charlottesville \\u201cby telling the full story of race through our public spaces.\\u201d The commission is slated to give its recommendations to the City Council in December.\\n\\nIn the wealthy, heavily Democratic city of Alexandria, a similar advisory group decided not to remove the Appomattox statue in the middle of Old Town, which depicts a defeated Confederate soldier with his eyes downcast. The United Daughters of the Confederacy owns the monument, and moving it would require approval from the Virginia General Assembly. Also, as the advisory group noted, Appomattox is one of the rare Confederate statues that marks a historic site\\u2014the place where the 17th Virginia Regiment gathered to withdraw from Union occupation of the city in 1861. The group recommended labeling the statue with more historical context instead of taking it down.\\n\\n\\u201cBlack Lives Matter\\u201d is spray painted on a monument to former Confederate President Jefferson Davis in Richmond, Virginia, in June 2015. | AP Photo\\n\\nRichmond, the former capital of the Confederacy, has an entire street lined with monuments to Confederate leaders. It\\u2019s also a majority-black city. In June 2015, someone scrawled \\u201cBlack Lives Matter\\u201d on the statue of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Yet Mayor Dwight Jones has not called for the monuments\\u2019 removal. Instead, he suggested adding more statues of prominent black leaders\\u2014such as the bronze of tennis legend Arthur Ashe, who was born in Richmond, that the city erected in 1995. \\u201cRather than tearing down, we should be building up in ways that establish a proper sense of balance and fairness by recognizing heroes from all eras to tell a richer and more accurate story of Virginia\\u2019s history,\\u201d Jones said in a statement last summer.\\n\\nDelegate Poindexter tends to agree with Jones, although he\\u2019s fuzzy on the specifics. Asked whether he would be in favor of adding more historical context to existing Confederate monuments, he says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s far better than tearing down the current ones.\\u201d\\n\\nIn his eyes, the era in which the Confederate monuments were erected is \\u201cirrelevant.\\u201d \\u201cThey need to be respected,\\u201d he says. \\u201cThey didn\\u2019t know what we know today. That\\u2019s why these monuments are important.\\u201d\\n\\nAyers says many people who push to preserve Confederate monuments share this attitude. \\u201cThe white South has always been on the defensive ever since it tried to leave the United States,\\u201d he says. \\u201cThey\\u2019ve taken what ground they can get, and what they can get is personal memory and memorialization. It\\u2019s an amalgam of power and weakness.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey\\u2019re meant to do work,\\u201d Ayers says. \\u201cThe work that they were meant to do, in some ways they\\u2019re still doing: Saying that this is a place where local white people call the shots.\\u201d\\n\\n***\\n\\nIn Franklin County, the power struggle is deeply personal. Stanley says the area sent about 3,000 Confederate soldiers to what she calls \\u201cThe War Between the States.\\u201d Veterans who returned home became mayors and town clerks and delegates. Beginning in 1902, the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy started raising money for a memorial to honor the sons, fathers and husbands who never made it home. They dedicated the monument in front of the courthouse in 1910.\\n\\nOne of the people who agreed to donate money to the project was Booker T. Washington, the famed African-American educator who was born into slavery on a farm in Franklin County in 1856. In 1905, he wrote a letter offering to contribute funds for the Confederate memorial, in honor of the family that owned him. As far as Stanley knows, Washington did contribute some amount, \\u201cwe just don\\u2019t have a copy of the actual check.\\u201d\\n\\nPoindexter says Franklin County \\u201clost hundreds of its best men\\u201d in the Civil War, and for decades afterward, Reconstruction was \\u201ca horrible process\\u201d that had a big impact on the region.\\n\\nToday, Franklin County is home to about 56,200 people, 90 percent of whom are white. They elected Poindexter, a conservative Christian with an \\u201cA\\u201d rating from the National Rifle Association, to the General Assembly for the first time in 2007. In 2014, the county had a median household income of $44,827, far below the state\\u2019s median of $64,792. Its residents voted Republican in the past three presidential races, and many supported Poindexter\\u2019s efforts to save war monuments. \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t want anybody pulling any monuments down,\\u201d Stanley says.\\n\\nSoon after the county replaced the Confederate memorial in front of the courthouse, the local chapter of the NAACP suggested that a statue of Booker T. Washington be erected beside it. Other community leaders wanted to put up a pedestal honoring African-Americans who contributed to the county\\u2019s Civil War effort. The county board of supervisors tabled their request, saying the community needed more time to discuss it.\\n\\nCivil War memorials are not generally a big tourist draw in the Roanoke region, says Landon Howard, president of Visit Virginia\\u2019s Blue Ridge. \\u201cTo be candid, we really do not get hardly any American Civil War visitation here.\\u201d\\n\\nYet locals have their own loyalties. Every year, the Franklin County Historical Society celebrates Veterans Memorial Day, honoring all local casualties of military conflicts. According to the society\\u2019s website, \\u201cSpecial emphasis is placed on veterans of the War Between the States as this war touched literally every household in the county.\\u201d\\n\\nConfederate General Jubal Early was born in Franklin County, and he\\u2019s known as one of the rebels who never surrendered. \\u201cHe became the primary spokesman for the Lost Cause and became the overwhelming authority on published Confederate history,\\u201d says the website of the Jubal A. Early Homeplace.\\n\\nSpeaking by phone from his farm in Franklin County, Poindexter isn\\u2019t ready to surrender, either. He doesn\\u2019t know whether he\\u2019ll propose his monument protection bill again next year, but he hasn\\u2019t ruled it out. \\u201cIf you start tearing down monuments ... where do you stop?\\u201d he says. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t change what was, but you can learn from it and not make that mistake again.\\u201d\\n\\nLisa Rab is a journalist in Charlotte, N.C.

People who watched the debate at parties, bars, restaurants, and offices were not counted. Neither were C-SPAN viewers.\\n\\nThis means the actual total audience is even higher.\\n\\nOn the TV side, CNN and other cable news channels saw big increases over past election years. So did the broadcast networks.\\n\\nNBC had the biggest audience overall, partly because \\\"NBC Nightly News\\\" anchor Lester Holt was the moderator of the debate. Upwards of 18 million people watched the debate on NBC.\\n\\nABC drew 13.5 million viewers, CBS drew 12.1 million, Fox News drew 11.4 million, CNN drew 9.9 million, the Fox broadcast network drew 5.5 million, and MSNBC drew 4.9 million.\\n\\nThe debate was also a hit on Spanish language television, attracting 2.5 million viewers on Univision and 1.8 million on Telemundo.\\n\\nTrump may have been the ratings magnet, but Clinton may have been the beneficiary of the ratings bump. By Tuesday there was a media consensus that Clinton had prevailed in the debate.\\n\\nThe debate viewership number to beat was 80.6 million, set back in 1980, when Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan debated just once before the election.\\n\\nMore recently, the first Obama-Romney debate in 2012 averaged 67 million viewers.\\n\\nDetailed Nielsen data confirms that viewership stayed high the entire time. Contrary to some speculation, there was not a big drop-off after the first 30 minutes of the 98-minute debate.\\n\\nThe vast majority of viewers kept watching until the very end, a fact that the Clinton campaign celebrated on Tuesday.\\n\\nEarlier story: Ratings expectations for first Trump-Clinton debate are sky high\\n\\nAnticipation for the Clinton-Trump meeting had been mounting for months. Television industry executives were anticipating a total audience somewhere between 80 and 100 million.\\n\\nThere will be two more debates between the candidates in October.\\n\\nOn Monday night Twitter said the first face-off was the \\\"most tweeted debate ever.\\\"\\n\\nGiven the rapid growth of streaming options, it was almost certainly the most streamed debate ever, as well.\\n\\nVarious live streams on YouTube together registered more than 2.5 million simultaneous viewers. Live streams on other sites also reached millions of people.\\n\\nOn both Twitter and Facebook, Trump was a livelier subject than Clinton. Twitter said the \\\"final share of conversation around the candidates on stage\\\" was 62% for Trump and 38% for Clinton.\\n\\nOn Facebook, the results were even more lopsided, with Trump earning 79% share of conversation and Clinton having the remaining 21%.\\n\\nBeing talked about isn't necessarily a good thing for a candidate. Most commentators gave Clinton the edge over Trump after the debate.\\n\\nStill, the post-debate coverage on TV focused on Trump, partly because of surprising and confounding comments he made on stage.\\n\\nCNN's reality check team investigated 26 claims made by Clinton and Trump and found that Trump made a greater number of misleading statements.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

People who watched the debate at parties, bars, restaurants, and offices were not counted. Neither were C-SPAN viewers.\\n\\nThis means the actual total audience is even higher.\\n\\nOn the TV side, CNN and other cable news channels saw big increases over past election years. So did the broadcast networks.\\n\\nNBC had the biggest audience overall, partly because \\\"NBC Nightly News\\\" anchor Lester Holt was the moderator of the debate. Upwards of 18 million people watched the debate on NBC.\\n\\nABC drew 13.5 million viewers, CBS drew 12.1 million, Fox News drew 11.4 million, CNN drew 9.9 million, the Fox broadcast network drew 5.5 million, and MSNBC drew 4.9 million.\\n\\nThe debate was also a hit on Spanish language television, attracting 2.5 million viewers on Univision and 1.8 million on Telemundo.\\n\\nTrump may have been the ratings magnet, but Clinton may have been the beneficiary of the ratings bump. By Tuesday there was a media consensus that Clinton had prevailed in the debate.\\n\\nThe debate viewership number to beat was 80.6 million, set back in 1980, when Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan debated just once before the election.\\n\\nMore recently, the first Obama-Romney debate in 2012 averaged 67 million viewers.\\n\\nDetailed Nielsen data confirms that viewership stayed high the entire time. Contrary to some speculation, there was not a big drop-off after the first 30 minutes of the 98-minute debate.\\n\\nThe vast majority of viewers kept watching until the very end, a fact that the Clinton campaign celebrated on Tuesday.\\n\\nEarlier story: Ratings expectations for first Trump-Clinton debate are sky high\\n\\nAnticipation for the Clinton-Trump meeting had been mounting for months. Television industry executives were anticipating a total audience somewhere between 80 and 100 million.\\n\\nThere will be two more debates between the candidates in October.\\n\\nOn Monday night Twitter said the first face-off was the \\\"most tweeted debate ever.\\\"\\n\\nGiven the rapid growth of streaming options, it was almost certainly the most streamed debate ever, as well.\\n\\nVarious live streams on YouTube together registered more than 2.5 million simultaneous viewers. Live streams on other sites also reached millions of people.\\n\\nOn both Twitter and Facebook, Trump was a livelier subject than Clinton. Twitter said the \\\"final share of conversation around the candidates on stage\\\" was 62% for Trump and 38% for Clinton.\\n\\nOn Facebook, the results were even more lopsided, with Trump earning 79% share of conversation and Clinton having the remaining 21%.\\n\\nBeing talked about isn't necessarily a good thing for a candidate. Most commentators gave Clinton the edge over Trump after the debate.\\n\\nStill, the post-debate coverage on TV focused on Trump, partly because of surprising and confounding comments he made on stage.\\n\\nCNN's reality check team investigated 26 claims made by Clinton and Trump and found that Trump made a greater number of misleading statements.\",\n          \"Nine years ago, a driver lost control of his pickup truck and crashed into the Confederate monument on the front lawn of the Franklin County Courthouse, decapitating the marble soldier. Some locals who found the monument offensive said they were glad to see it go, but there was never much doubt that once the money was raised, the soldier would be back.\\n\\nThe rededication ceremony in 2010 drew a crowd of about 500 people\\u2014women wore hoop skirts and men donned the gray uniforms of Confederate soldiers. \\u201cWe\\u2019re very proud of it,\\u201d says Linda Stanley, managing director of the Franklin County Historical Society in Rocky Mount, Virginia, 25 miles southeast of Roanoke. \\u201cThis whole county\\u2019s very, very patriotic.\\u201d\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nThis was the way skirmishes over Confederate history have often gone\\u2014history is replaced, not rewritten. That is, until last year, when white supremacist Dylann Roof gunned down nine people at an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina. The massacre set off a national debate about Confederate symbols in public places, leading to an intense and ultimately successful campaign to permanently remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol grounds, where it had flown for decades.\\n\\nBut for every nationally publicized debate like the one over South Carolina\\u2019s flag, there are dozens of smaller battles in places like Franklin County. And this is especially true in Virginia, which, as the former home to the capital of the Confederacy, has more Confederate monuments\\u2014223\\u2014than any other state. Virginia, increasingly diverse and progressive, embodies the friction between the economic aspirations of the \\u201cNew South\\u201d and the still powerful nostalgia of the Old Dominion, and it\\u2019s a drama that is playing out in town squares across the state.\\n\\nThough a Quinnipiac University poll last summer found Virginians evenly divided on the governor\\u2019s decision to remove the Confederate flag from state license plates, pride in local monuments remains strong. When city leaders in Danville, on Virginia\\u2019s southern border, voted to remove a Confederate flag from the grounds of the Sutherlin Mansion\\u2014known as the Last Capitol of the Confederacy\\u2014Confederate preservationists struck back. They filed a lawsuit seeking to have the flag reinstated, arguing that it was part of a war memorial, and that Virginia law protected all war memorials in the state. Last fall, a circuit court judge ruled against them.\\n\\nThat ruling\\u2014along with the increasingly frequent threats to monuments around the state\\u2014prompted the Republican delegate from Franklin County to demand in January a blanket protection for what has been a feature of Southern urban landscapes for more than a century. Charles Poindexter introduced a bill in the General Assembly to prevent the removal of all war monuments, regardless of when they were built. \\u201cIf you eliminate these monuments and memorials, you\\u2019re taking away the opportunity to learn the history of the country\\u2014to learn the good, the bad and ugly,\\u201d Poindexter says.\\n\\nMany of his colleagues in the Virginia Legislature agreed with him. But in March, Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed the bill, saying cities and towns should decide what to do with their Confederate monuments, based on their individual histories. Some historians and civic leaders think the debate over Confederate symbols in public spaces, which began in the 1960s, will take decades to play out.\\n\\n\\u201cEvery little statue\\u2019s a part of a much larger discussion and movement,\\u201d says Edward Ayers, former president of the University of Richmond and noted Civil War historian. \\u201cAfrican-Americans now have a political voice, and this is one of the things that they\\u2019re using it for.\\u201d\\n\\n***\\n\\nMark Whitaker remembers walking by the 30-foot-tall Confederate monument in Portsmouth, Virginia, when he was a kid. Shopping at a store across the street, he resented looking at the obelisk guarded by stone soldiers; his parents had told him what it represented. \\u201cMy ancestors could not say a thing in the face of that indignity,\\u201d Whitaker says.\\n\\nNow, as an African-American City Council member in a city that is 53 percent black, he wants to remove the monument from the center of Olde Towne, and perhaps put it in a cemetery. \\u201cThese monuments are really a rally and a celebration [of] the rise of an institution that oppressed black people,\\u201d he says.\\n\\nMany of the Confederate monuments were built from the 1880s through the 1920s, an era when Civil War veterans were dying and their descendants were eager to honor them. It was also the era immediately following Reconstruction, when federal troops abandoned the South and whites aimed to reassert power through Jim Crow laws, lynchings and groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. Granite and marble monuments proclaimed that power, often in the center of town.\\n\\nBut even in a majority-black city on the eastern shore of the state, Whitaker has battled to get Portsmouth\\u2019s monument removed. Last summer, attorney Fred Taylor, who also represented Confederate preservationists in the Danville case, warned the city that state law prohibited it from moving the monument. \\u201cWe believe the monument protection act covers the monument in Danville, covers the monument in Portsmouth,\\u201d Taylor says. He argues that the original Virginia statute protecting war monuments dates back to 1902, so \\u201cthere has been protection all along.\\u201d\\n\\nWhen the circuit court judge ruled against him in Danville, Taylor appealed the case to the Virginia Supreme Court. So far, the court has not agreed to hear the case.\\n\\nBack in Portsmouth, the debate continues. Some residents don\\u2019t want the city to spend upward of $100,000 to move the monument\\u2014a position Whitaker finds ridiculous. \\u201cWhy now, when we talk about moving a symbol of racism, we\\u2019re concerned about cost?\\u201d\\n\\nHe says the Portsmouth City Council had been waiting to hear the outcome of the Danville court case but could resume its discussion of the monument after the November elections. \\u201cWe\\u2019re on solid legal grounds to remove it,\\u201d he says. \\u201cWe just need four votes.\\u201d\\n\\n***\\n\\nOther Virginia cities have struck a middle ground, forming committees to figure out what to do with their Confederate monuments. In May, Charlottesville convened a Blue Ribbon Commission on Race, Memorials, and Public Spaces. Although the move was sparked by a controversial statue of Robert E. Lee in a public park, Mayor Mike Signer was determined to broaden the conversation, with an eye toward changing the city\\u2019s entire historic landscape.\\n\\nHe asked the commission to look at several landmarks, from an African-American cemetery that had fallen into disrepair to the statue of a Confederate boy in front of the courthouse. Members of the panel have discussed rehabbing and creating new historic interpretations for these sites, building new monuments to African-American leaders and linking all the sites so that visitors can see how they are connected. There might even be a virtual, mobile educational component to help people navigate the sites. The goal, Signer says, is to change the narrative of Charlottesville \\u201cby telling the full story of race through our public spaces.\\u201d The commission is slated to give its recommendations to the City Council in December.\\n\\nIn the wealthy, heavily Democratic city of Alexandria, a similar advisory group decided not to remove the Appomattox statue in the middle of Old Town, which depicts a defeated Confederate soldier with his eyes downcast. The United Daughters of the Confederacy owns the monument, and moving it would require approval from the Virginia General Assembly. Also, as the advisory group noted, Appomattox is one of the rare Confederate statues that marks a historic site\\u2014the place where the 17th Virginia Regiment gathered to withdraw from Union occupation of the city in 1861. The group recommended labeling the statue with more historical context instead of taking it down.\\n\\n\\u201cBlack Lives Matter\\u201d is spray painted on a monument to former Confederate President Jefferson Davis in Richmond, Virginia, in June 2015. | AP Photo\\n\\nRichmond, the former capital of the Confederacy, has an entire street lined with monuments to Confederate leaders. It\\u2019s also a majority-black city. In June 2015, someone scrawled \\u201cBlack Lives Matter\\u201d on the statue of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Yet Mayor Dwight Jones has not called for the monuments\\u2019 removal. Instead, he suggested adding more statues of prominent black leaders\\u2014such as the bronze of tennis legend Arthur Ashe, who was born in Richmond, that the city erected in 1995. \\u201cRather than tearing down, we should be building up in ways that establish a proper sense of balance and fairness by recognizing heroes from all eras to tell a richer and more accurate story of Virginia\\u2019s history,\\u201d Jones said in a statement last summer.\\n\\nDelegate Poindexter tends to agree with Jones, although he\\u2019s fuzzy on the specifics. Asked whether he would be in favor of adding more historical context to existing Confederate monuments, he says, \\u201cIt\\u2019s far better than tearing down the current ones.\\u201d\\n\\nIn his eyes, the era in which the Confederate monuments were erected is \\u201cirrelevant.\\u201d \\u201cThey need to be respected,\\u201d he says. \\u201cThey didn\\u2019t know what we know today. That\\u2019s why these monuments are important.\\u201d\\n\\nAyers says many people who push to preserve Confederate monuments share this attitude. \\u201cThe white South has always been on the defensive ever since it tried to leave the United States,\\u201d he says. \\u201cThey\\u2019ve taken what ground they can get, and what they can get is personal memory and memorialization. It\\u2019s an amalgam of power and weakness.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThey\\u2019re meant to do work,\\u201d Ayers says. \\u201cThe work that they were meant to do, in some ways they\\u2019re still doing: Saying that this is a place where local white people call the shots.\\u201d\\n\\n***\\n\\nIn Franklin County, the power struggle is deeply personal. Stanley says the area sent about 3,000 Confederate soldiers to what she calls \\u201cThe War Between the States.\\u201d Veterans who returned home became mayors and town clerks and delegates. Beginning in 1902, the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy started raising money for a memorial to honor the sons, fathers and husbands who never made it home. They dedicated the monument in front of the courthouse in 1910.\\n\\nOne of the people who agreed to donate money to the project was Booker T. Washington, the famed African-American educator who was born into slavery on a farm in Franklin County in 1856. In 1905, he wrote a letter offering to contribute funds for the Confederate memorial, in honor of the family that owned him. As far as Stanley knows, Washington did contribute some amount, \\u201cwe just don\\u2019t have a copy of the actual check.\\u201d\\n\\nPoindexter says Franklin County \\u201clost hundreds of its best men\\u201d in the Civil War, and for decades afterward, Reconstruction was \\u201ca horrible process\\u201d that had a big impact on the region.\\n\\nToday, Franklin County is home to about 56,200 people, 90 percent of whom are white. They elected Poindexter, a conservative Christian with an \\u201cA\\u201d rating from the National Rifle Association, to the General Assembly for the first time in 2007. In 2014, the county had a median household income of $44,827, far below the state\\u2019s median of $64,792. Its residents voted Republican in the past three presidential races, and many supported Poindexter\\u2019s efforts to save war monuments. \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t want anybody pulling any monuments down,\\u201d Stanley says.\\n\\nSoon after the county replaced the Confederate memorial in front of the courthouse, the local chapter of the NAACP suggested that a statue of Booker T. Washington be erected beside it. Other community leaders wanted to put up a pedestal honoring African-Americans who contributed to the county\\u2019s Civil War effort. The county board of supervisors tabled their request, saying the community needed more time to discuss it.\\n\\nCivil War memorials are not generally a big tourist draw in the Roanoke region, says Landon Howard, president of Visit Virginia\\u2019s Blue Ridge. \\u201cTo be candid, we really do not get hardly any American Civil War visitation here.\\u201d\\n\\nYet locals have their own loyalties. Every year, the Franklin County Historical Society celebrates Veterans Memorial Day, honoring all local casualties of military conflicts. According to the society\\u2019s website, \\u201cSpecial emphasis is placed on veterans of the War Between the States as this war touched literally every household in the county.\\u201d\\n\\nConfederate General Jubal Early was born in Franklin County, and he\\u2019s known as one of the rebels who never surrendered. \\u201cHe became the primary spokesman for the Lost Cause and became the overwhelming authority on published Confederate history,\\u201d says the website of the Jubal A. Early Homeplace.\\n\\nSpeaking by phone from his farm in Franklin County, Poindexter isn\\u2019t ready to surrender, either. He doesn\\u2019t know whether he\\u2019ll propose his monument protection bill again next year, but he hasn\\u2019t ruled it out. \\u201cIf you start tearing down monuments ... where do you stop?\\u201d he says. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t change what was, but you can learn from it and not make that mistake again.\\u201d\\n\\nLisa Rab is a journalist in Charlotte, N.C.

People who watched the debate at parties, bars, restaurants, and offices were not counted. Neither were C-SPAN viewers.\\n\\nThis means the actual total audience is even higher.\\n\\nOn the TV side, CNN and other cable news channels saw big increases over past election years. So did the broadcast networks.\\n\\nNBC had the biggest audience overall, partly because \\\"NBC Nightly News\\\" anchor Lester Holt was the moderator of the debate. Upwards of 18 million people watched the debate on NBC.\\n\\nABC drew 13.5 million viewers, CBS drew 12.1 million, Fox News drew 11.4 million, CNN drew 9.9 million, the Fox broadcast network drew 5.5 million, and MSNBC drew 4.9 million.\\n\\nThe debate was also a hit on Spanish language television, attracting 2.5 million viewers on Univision and 1.8 million on Telemundo.\\n\\nTrump may have been the ratings magnet, but Clinton may have been the beneficiary of the ratings bump. By Tuesday there was a media consensus that Clinton had prevailed in the debate.\\n\\nThe debate viewership number to beat was 80.6 million, set back in 1980, when Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan debated just once before the election.\\n\\nMore recently, the first Obama-Romney debate in 2012 averaged 67 million viewers.\\n\\nDetailed Nielsen data confirms that viewership stayed high the entire time. Contrary to some speculation, there was not a big drop-off after the first 30 minutes of the 98-minute debate.\\n\\nThe vast majority of viewers kept watching until the very end, a fact that the Clinton campaign celebrated on Tuesday.\\n\\nEarlier story: Ratings expectations for first Trump-Clinton debate are sky high\\n\\nAnticipation for the Clinton-Trump meeting had been mounting for months. Television industry executives were anticipating a total audience somewhere between 80 and 100 million.\\n\\nThere will be two more debates between the candidates in October.\\n\\nOn Monday night Twitter said the first face-off was the \\\"most tweeted debate ever.\\\"\\n\\nGiven the rapid growth of streaming options, it was almost certainly the most streamed debate ever, as well.\\n\\nVarious live streams on YouTube together registered more than 2.5 million simultaneous viewers. Live streams on other sites also reached millions of people.\\n\\nOn both Twitter and Facebook, Trump was a livelier subject than Clinton. Twitter said the \\\"final share of conversation around the candidates on stage\\\" was 62% for Trump and 38% for Clinton.\\n\\nOn Facebook, the results were even more lopsided, with Trump earning 79% share of conversation and Clinton having the remaining 21%.\\n\\nBeing talked about isn't necessarily a good thing for a candidate. Most commentators gave Clinton the edge over Trump after the debate.\\n\\nStill, the post-debate coverage on TV focused on Trump, partly because of surprising and confounding comments he made on stage.\\n\\nCNN's reality check team investigated 26 claims made by Clinton and Trump and found that Trump made a greater number of misleading statements.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "'Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:\\n\\nBill Clinton: ‘Natural’ For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors\\n\\nHere’s Google:\\n\\nNaturally, my reaction was “oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife’s campaign now?”\\n\\nOf course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don’t do, to find out the real story – and the real story is that there is no pay to play.\\n\\n“It was natural for people who’ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn’t do anything they shouldn’t do,” Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN\\n\\nIn other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there’s no evidence they got them.\\n\\nNow, let’s talk about the foundation the media doesn’t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn’t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.\\n\\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump’s charitable foundation over concerns that it “engaged in some impropriety” as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others’ contributions “to make them appear to have come from him” although he “hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.” Source: Media Matters\\n\\nMedia Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton’s candidacy:\\n\\nJournalists have been criticized for the “double standard” in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post’s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump’s Dr. Oz stunt.\\n\\nAll of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton “scandal” (if you call getting sick a “scandal”) while ignoring every scandal in Trump’s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.\\n\\nFeatured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images.'"

Sander Levin called on the IRS Wednesday to audit The Trump Foundation, following a report that the billionaire used charity money to pay off legal settlements.\\n\\n\\\"It is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes, rather than promote the business ventures of those affiliated with the charity. I therefore request an immediate audit of the Donald J. Trump Foundation,\\\" Levin wrote in a letter to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen\\n\\nThe Washington Post reported earlier this week that Trump used $258,000 from his charity to pay off settlements in a pair of lawsuits. The Post reported that Trump used the charity to pay for a $100,000 settlement with the city of Palm Beach in 2007 and used another $158,000 from his charity to settle a lawsuit filed in 2011 about a hole-in-one claim at a charity golf tournament.\\n\\nThe revelation immediately drew accusations from Democrats of Trump self-dealing. Messages left with the Trump campaign and the IRS were not immediately returned Wednesday.\\n\\nBut New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a top Trump surrogate, warned Hillary Clinton's campaign Wednesday of using the allegations against the Trump Foundation for a political attack.\\n\\nRead More\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

But Republican Donald Trump\\u2019s 2016 White House bid has motivated Wade to get involved and he plans to support the real estate mogul in Nevada\\u2019s nominating caucus next month. Trump is a \\u201cnon-politician\\u201d who can fix the \\u201cchaos\\u201d in Washington, he says. About one in 10 Americans who plan to cast a vote this election will do so for the first time in years, if ever, and Trump holds a decided edge with them, according to polling by Reuters/Ipsos. (tmsnrt.rs/1SgeLvi) These voters offer Trump a pool of voters who could be decisive either in the Republican primaries or a general election. They could be crucial for Trump in early-voting states such as Iowa and South Carolina, where his nearest rival, Senator Ted Cruz, is putting pressure on Trump and enjoys a strong base of support with more traditionally conservative voters. In Reuters/Ipsos polling from June to December 2015, 27.3 percent of these \\u201cnew\\u201d voters said they would vote for Trump, higher than his poll numbers among independents and Republicans who regularly vote. By way of comparison, Cruz captures just 3.4 percent of these voters. And Senator Marco Rubio of Florida snags only 4 percent. \\u201cI\\u2019m tired of the chaos between Democrats and Republicans and want to give somebody a try who I think can make a difference,\\u201d said Wade of Trump. The 51-year-old has already switched his affiliation from Democrat to Republican and even attended a Trump campaign event in Las Vegas. He has told his three older children to get involved in the elections, although he did not say whether he wanted them to vote for Trump.  Trump, the Republican front-runner, has made targeting \\u201clost\\u201d voters such as Wade a focus of his campaign. His anti-immigrant rhetoric and protectionist trade proposals have helped him to fashion a message tailored to reach Americans alienated by the endless enmity between the political parties and who, because of declining economic prospects, may feel like neither party has done much for them. Trump\\u2019s strategy is a gamble, given the lack of reliability of many of the voters with whom he is most popular. In interviews, some of those lost voters insist they will show up, saying they are drawn to Trump\\u2019s outsider status and his willingness to upend the political system. Tucson, Arizona, resident Renay Cunningham, 56, said she had never paid much attention to politics in the past. She plans to cast her first ever vote for Trump after hearing his proposed policies to curb illegal immigration, which include building a giant wall on the southern border and making Mexico pay for it. \\u201cWe need a piranha in there, and he\\u2019s definitely a piranha,\\u201d she said. Trump and his operatives are confident they can do what few of his rivals for the Republican nomination have shown they can do \\u2014 expand the party\\u2019s potential voter pool. But while Democrat Barack Obama did that eight years ago by largely registering new voters, including record levels of minorities, both male and female, in urban centers, Trump\\u2019s campaign has instead largely sought out the disaffected, who tend to be overwhelmingly older, white, and less educated than the broader electorate. \\u201cMy whole campaign has been focused on expanding the number of people who want to, and will, participate in this election cycle,\\u201d Trump wrote in a recent op-ed in USA Today. When analyzing \\u201clost\\u201d or \\u201cnew\\u201d voters, Reuters compiled poll results from people who haven\\u2019t voted in the previous two presidential campaigns and midterm congressional elections. The results focused only on those who said they were nearly certain to vote in the November election. It included responses from 3,440 \\u201cnew\\u201d Republican and independent voters \\u2013 a sample that has a credibility interval of 2 percentage points. Jan Leighley, an expert on turnout at American University, said it\\u2019s too soon to compare Trump\\u2019s \\u201cnew\\u201d voters with the disenfranchised voters, especially minorities, who in 2008 turned out in record numbers to elect the first black president. Those voters didn\\u2019t find their way to the polls simply because they were inspired to make history, Leighley said. \\u201cHe also had a kick-ass mobilization structure.\\u201d \\u201cObama\\u2019s campaign went door-to-door. They canvassed whole neighborhoods. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if he (Trump) has the campaign infrastructure to make sure that the folks who are riled up are walked to the polls on Election Day,\\u201d she said. Trump\\u2019s campaign insists he does have the infrastructure, but won\\u2019t provide specifics on how it intends to turn casual supporters into engaged voters. The campaign says it does follow up with the thousands of attendees who jam arenas for Trump\\u2019s rallies. That\\u2019s one significant advantage the reality star has over the other candidates in the Republican field, as the challenge in reaching voters who have fallen out of the political process often lies in simply locating them. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve identified a lot of people in early primary states who have not participated in the process before,\\u201d campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told Reuters. Lewandowski resists the notion that Trump needs to turn out \\u201cnew\\u201d or reluctant voters to win states such as Iowa. Even if the Trump campaign isn\\u2019t necessarily counting on them, it may be reassuring that his supporters among \\u201cnew\\u201d voters who responded to the Reuters/Ipsos survey appear motivated to cast a vote for him. At least for the time being. Ronald Thomas, a 49-year-old truck driver and Navy veteran in North Carolina, said he, too, has never voted in a presidential contest. His girlfriend would push him to vote but he would always say \\u201cYeah, but the right one ain\\u2019t come along yet,\\u2019\\u201d Thomas said. Trump is that man. His willingness to take on the government has set him apart as someone who would \\u201cactually look out for the people,\\u201d said Thomas. Now he wants to know how to register so that he can vote for the billionaire.  And there\\u2019s Vince DiSylvester, a retired maintenance worker in Missouri, who, at 73, said has never cast a ballot for president. But Trump has inspired him to rethink that. \\u201cHe\\u2019s a businessman, he knows business, he knows how to get things done,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd he tells it like it is. If you don\\u2019t like it - well, too bad.\\u201d  (Editing by Ross Colvin) SAP is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of Reuters News Agency.\",\n          \"Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander, another fighter, killed in Syria: Iranian media BEIRUT (Reuters) - A commander in Iran s elite Revolutionary Guards and a lower-ranking Iranian fighter have been killed fighting Islamic State in Syria in recent days, Iranian media reported on Sunday. The Revolutionary Guards, Iran s most powerful military force which also oversees an economic empire worth billions of dollars, have been fighting in support of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad for several years. An Iranian official told the Tasnim news agency last year that more than 1,000 Iranians have been killed in Syria. Senior members of the Guards have been among those killed. Kheyrollah Samadi, a Guards commander in charge of a unit in Syria, died on Thursday in fighting in the Albu Kamal region, bordering Iraq, according to Fars News. Samadi was killed in clashes with Islamic State, according to the Ghatreh news site. Iranian media have previously reported on fighting in that area between Iran s Shi ite militia allies and Islamic State. The Syrian army and its allies took complete control over Albu Kamal, Islamic State s last significant town in Syria, a military news service run by Hezbollah said on Sunday. Samadi, who fought in the Iran-Iraq war during the 1980s and had retired from the Iranian military before signing on to go to Syria, was killed by a mortar explosion, Fars News, a news agency, said. Iranian news sites posted pictures on Sunday of Samadi with Qassem Soleimani, head of the Guards branch responsible for operations outside Iran. The lower-ranking Iranian fighter, Mehdi Movahednia, was killed on Saturday in clashes with Islamic State in the town of Mayadin in eastern Syria, Fars News reported. The Revolutionary Guards initially kept quiet about their role in the Syria conflict. But in recent years, as casualties have mounted, they have been more outspoken about their engagement, framing it as an existential struggle against the Sunni Muslim fighters of Islamic State who see Shi ites, the majority of Iran s population, as apostates. On web sites linked to the Guards, members of the organization killed in Syria and Iraq are praised as protectors of Shi ite holy sites and labeled  defenders of the shrine . U.S. President Donald Trump last month gave the U.S. Treasury Department authority to impose economic sanctions on members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in response to what Washington calls its efforts to destabilize and undermine its opponents in the Middle East. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It is not just a matter of preventing illegal immigration, but securing an essential access point into America.\\r\\n\\r\\nLaw enforcement is on high alert after a routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions. Police in Luna County, New Mexico, pulled over an undocumented Middle Eastern woman with the plans for a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area.\\r\\n(via Mad News World)\\r\\n\\r\\nPolice were unable to determine why the woman, described as an \\u201cIslamic refugee,\\u201d was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plans detailed a pipeline in Deming, New Mexico. The FBI\\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Force was deployed with the U.S. Border Patrol to investigate the area. The search came up empty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pipeline identified in the Muslim woman\\u2019s plans is fairly remote, leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is troubling to discover an undocumented Muslim woman in a county sharing a border with Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\nA report released by Judicial Watch in 2015 revealed that Mexican cartels were working with terror organizations. The report indicates that Mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.\\r\\n\\r\\nJudicial Watch also revealed in a 2017 report that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into America to scout out potential targets.\\r\\n\\r\\nCongress should approve funding for President Trump\\u2019s border wall at once. It is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration. Many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into America.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the illegal immigrants entering America are not even from Mexico. Instead, aliens from south of Mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the American-Mexican border. Many of these aliens receive active support from the Mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a terrorist wanted to sneak into America to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. They could start their journey south of Mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border. Until we do, our country is easy pickings.\",\n          \"McConnell, Pelosi, Ryan seek deal on government funding impasse AP Photo McConnell, Pelosi, Ryan seek deal on government funding impasse A total of $170 million for the Flint water crisis is added to the WRDA bill.\\n\\nSpeaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi are trying to hash out an agreement to break an impasse over government funding as the Sept. 30 budget deadline fast approaches.\\n\\nIn a series of three-way discussions on Tuesday night, the trio of party leaders were forging a compromise to extend government funding until Dec. 9. In turn, Republicans would provide an \\\"iron-clad commitment\\\" that funding to address the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, will be included in the Water Resources Development Act, which covers hundreds of federal water projects.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nLate Tuesday, congressional leaders made headway on at least one part of the multi-layered discussions: Pelosi and Ryan agreed to incorporate an amendment to the sweeping waters legislation that would add about $170 million in federal aid for Flint.\\n\\n\\\"The amendment represents a bipartisan agreement between Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi to allow germane authorization language to be added to WRDA as an amendment that will, at the end of the day, provide the necessary funding Flint needs in the final WRDA conference report,\\\" a Pelosi aide said late Tuesday night. The water resources legislation could head to the House floor as early as Wednesday.\\n\\nPelosi and other Democrats had refused to support any continuing resolution, or a CR, to keep the government open without the Flint funding. Ryan, for his part, faced problems rounding up GOP votes for a short-term funding bill.\\n\\nWith Ryan and Pelosi holding direct talks, a deal was expected soon to break the impasse. McConnell and Pelosi had also held discussions on the Flint-WRDA issue, said GOP and Democratic sources. McConnell had been pushing to include Flint funding in the WRDA package. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) had been making his own insistence for Flint aid clear with Republicans.\\n\\nEarlier, Senate Republicans had been considering stripping Louisiana disaster aid money from the stalled stopgap spending bill, which in theory could have resolved Senate Democratic objections to the legislation and ultimately stave off a government shutdown at the end of the week. That proposal had come after Democrats voted Tuesday to reject the stopgap spending measure \\u2014 which would keep the government open until Dec. 9 \\u2014 because the package provides money for Louisiana and other states but did nothing to address Flint.\\n\\nMcConnell had been expected to unveil a revised legislative text with no Louisiana disaster relief, one senior GOP leadership aide said, but any formal action will now wait until Wednesday. The Kentucky Republican floated the idea at a news conference Tuesday shortly before the procedural vote failed 45-55, far short of the 60-vote threshold.\\n\\n\\\"We keep hearing that their position is no Flint, no floods,\\\" McConnell said. \\\"That's certainly an option worth discussing.\\\"\\n\\nInformed of that comment, Reid told reporters he wanted to see exactly what McConnell would do, and again said Democrats wanted relief for both Louisiana and Flint.\\n\\nBut other Democrats suggested the move would pave the way to a resolution. \\\"If Louisiana were not in there, it would reduce the profile of disaster aid in this bill. And that would be helpful,\\u201d said Senate Minority Whip Richard Durbin.\\n\\n\\u201cThere's still really deep felt feelings by our Michigan senators and many others that this is just fundamentally unfair to the victims in Flint and we don't trust the House to help at all,\\u201d Durbin added.\\n\\nHouse Minority Whip Steny Hoyer also said Democrats wanted assistance for victims in both communities, but that they would likely back a so-called continuing resolution that included aid for neither. \\u201cI doubt that we would turn that down,\\u201d he told reporters. Hoyer said Democrats would insist the legislation still contain $1.1 billion to combat the Zika virus, which has long been stalled on Capitol Hill. The measure also includes popular provisions to fund veterans programs and implement a July law to curb prescription opioid addiction.\\n\\nSenate Republicans had argued that the proper place for Flint aid is water infrastructure bill moving through Congress. The Senate passed the Water Resources Development Act, which includes $220 million for Flint and other communities with failing infrastructure, on a 95-3 vote earlier this month.\\n\\n\\u201cWhy do you feel as if you have to punish people in Louisiana who are digging out from a flood \\u2014 sounds kind of crazy, but they have mud in their home they have to dig out \\u2014 for Flint when there\\u2019s a pathway forward on Flint through the WRDA bill?\\u201d argued GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy, who has repeatedly pressed the need for flood aid for his home state of Louisiana.\\n\\nStill, despite vows from some Senate Republicans that Flint aid will be included in any final bill negotiated by the House and Senate in a lame duck session, Democrats had been skeptical.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Democrats also objected to language in the stopgap bill that continues a prohibition on the Securities and Exchange Commission\\u2019s ability to require corporate disclosure of political spending. But that provision has been a secondary issue to the fight over Flint.\\n\\nMcConnell and Reid each accused the other of bringing the federal government to the brink of a shutdown, but few think such a politically-damaging scenario would take place just weeks before the presidential election. If the Senate is able to pass a funding bill, the House would be expected to follow suit relatively quickly.\\n\\nAmong the 45 votes in favor of the bill were four Democrats, including those representing conservative leaning states, like Jon Tester of Montana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, as well as Bill Nelson of Florida, where the Zika virus is spreading quickly.\\n\\nThirteen Republicans joined most Democrats in voting against the bill, including conservatives Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, and South Carolina\\u2019s Lindsey Graham. Cruz led a failed fight to include language blocking the Obama administration from relinquishing oversight of the Internet domain system to an international body. Graham promised to oppose the bill because it would not lift financing restrictions on the Export-Import Bank.\\n\\nHeather Caygle, Rachael Bade and Annie Snider contributed to this story.\\n\\nAuthors:\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The first in a new series: a message from your potential next president on pregnancy,  Clinton says to introduce the clip on Twitter.It s only an 18 second snippet. Hail to the Chief plays in the background and then Donald Trump appears to give his brief thoughts on pregnancy. Well you know, pregnancy is never   it s a wonderful thing for the woman, it s a wonderful thing for the husband, it s certainly an inconvenience for business,  Trump says.Here s the video via Twitter.The first in a new series: a message from your potential next president on pregnancy.https://t.co/LmUZI20JCo  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 27, 2016So all you women out there who manage to work and have a family, Trump wants you to know that you are an  inconvenience for business. Yeah, that s probably going to piss off a lot of women. And that s the point. Hillary Clinton is laying the groundwork for the general election by releasing these short clips featuring Trump and all the stupid and offensive remarks he has made on issue after issue over the years.Trump is already the Republican nominee so if Hillary captures the Democratic nomination, she would be battling Trump for the White House and America s future.The orange-tanned businessman certainly has a steep cliff to climb when it comes to women voters.70 percent of women hold an unfavorable view of Trump. And an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Clinton leading Trump 51 to 38 percent among female voters, a 13 point gap that is wider than President Obama s victory over Mitt Romney among women in 2012. NPR reports that if the numbers hold the gender gap would be the widest it has ever been since 1952, which makes it clear that the Republican Party is in serious trouble if they think they can win election merely by courting the votes of white old men.Hillary certainly has plenty of ammunition to fire at Trump with future videos, too. After all, we re talking about a guy who has suggested on mulitple occasions that he wants to have incestuous relations with his daughter, a guy who has openly stated that he is more interested in getting women pregnant than he is in helping to take care of the kids after they are born. I like kids,  Trump once said.  I mean, I won t do anything to take care of them. I ll supply funds and she ll take care of the kids. It s quotes like this that could bury Trump this November if Hillary Clinton gathers enough of them to use in short videos that will definitely appeal to those who don t have the patience to sit through an entire Trump interview or debate.Trump and and GOP should take note, because it looks like their poll numbers are about to get worse.Featured image via screenshot \",\n          \"Syria's militant ex-Qaeda group denies leader injured in Russian strike AMMAN (Reuters) - Syria s Tahrir al-Sham militant group denied in a statement on social media on Wednesday that its leader had been critically wounded in a Russian air strike and said he was in good health and performing his duties.

The first in a new series: a message from your potential next president on pregnancy,  Clinton says to introduce the clip on Twitter.It s only an 18 second snippet. Hail to the Chief plays in the background and then Donald Trump appears to give his brief thoughts on pregnancy. Well you know, pregnancy is never   it s a wonderful thing for the woman, it s a wonderful thing for the husband, it s certainly an inconvenience for business,  Trump says.Here s the video via Twitter.The first in a new series: a message from your potential next president on pregnancy.https://t.co/LmUZI20JCo  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 27, 2016So all you women out there who manage to work and have a family, Trump wants you to know that you are an  inconvenience for business. Yeah, that s probably going to piss off a lot of women. And that s the point. Hillary Clinton is laying the groundwork for the general election by releasing these short clips featuring Trump and all the stupid and offensive remarks he has made on issue after issue over the years.Trump is already the Republican nominee so if Hillary captures the Democratic nomination, she would be battling Trump for the White House and America s future.The orange-tanned businessman certainly has a steep cliff to climb when it comes to women voters.70 percent of women hold an unfavorable view of Trump. And an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Clinton leading Trump 51 to 38 percent among female voters, a 13 point gap that is wider than President Obama s victory over Mitt Romney among women in 2012. NPR reports that if the numbers hold the gender gap would be the widest it has ever been since 1952, which makes it clear that the Republican Party is in serious trouble if they think they can win election merely by courting the votes of white old men.Hillary certainly has plenty of ammunition to fire at Trump with future videos, too. After all, we re talking about a guy who has suggested on mulitple occasions that he wants to have incestuous relations with his daughter, a guy who has openly stated that he is more interested in getting women pregnant than he is in helping to take care of the kids after they are born. I like kids,  Trump once said.  I mean, I won t do anything to take care of them. I ll supply funds and she ll take care of the kids. It s quotes like this that could bury Trump this November if Hillary Clinton gathers enough of them to use in short videos that will definitely appeal to those who don t have the patience to sit through an entire Trump interview or debate.Trump and and GOP should take note, because it looks like their poll numbers are about to get worse.Featured image via screenshot \",\n          \"Syria's militant ex-Qaeda group denies leader injured in Russian strike AMMAN (Reuters) - Syria s Tahrir al-Sham militant group denied in a statement on social media on Wednesday that its leader had been critically wounded in a Russian air strike and said he was in good health and performing his duties. The Russian Defence Ministry said it had seriously injured Abu Mohamad al-Golani on Oct. 3 in an intelligence-led special operation while he was meeting his field commanders. Golani headed the Nusra Front, the former al Qaeda affiliate, before it merged with other groups to form Tahrir al-Sham. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3147,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"congress,history,legal-issues,supreme-court\",\n          \"immigration,state-finances\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
